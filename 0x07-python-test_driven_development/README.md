0x07. Python - Test-driven development
======================================

	Test-driven development (TDD) in Python is an iterative software development approach where tests are written before the actual code,
	ensuring functionality and enabling continuous refinement, fostering robust and maintainable Python applications.

	Task 0: Write a function that adds 2 integers.

	Task 1: Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
